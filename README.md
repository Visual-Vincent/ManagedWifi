## Original description
.NET managed wrapper around the Windows Native Wifi API.

This project is a .NET class library allowing you to control Wifi (802.11) network adapters installed in your Windows machine programmatically.

The library uses the [Native Wifi API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/nativewifi/about-the-native-wifi-api?redirectedfrom=MSDN), available since Windows Vista and Windows XP SP2 (in a limited fashion, and only after applying a hotfix provided in [KB article 918997](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/918997)). Older versions of Windows are not supported.

You can find sample code in the [WifiExample directory](WifiExample).

This code was developed as part of our work at [Monfort Software Engineering](https://www.monfort.co.il/).
